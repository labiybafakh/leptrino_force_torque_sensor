# Leptrino Force Torque Sensor
 
 This code is refered and used for [Leptrino 6-DoF Force Torque Sensor](http://www.leptrino.co.jp/P_CFS.html).
It is also forked from [hiveground](https://github.com/hiveground-ros-package/leptrino_force_torque).

A ROS 1 repository interfaces 6-DoF Leptrino Force Sensor. The offset of force sensor has been calculated to get actual force.
